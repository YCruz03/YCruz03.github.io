    <p>THE ORIGINAL...</p>
    <p>The original Mulan was released in 1998, bringing with it Mushu,
      voiced by Eddie Murphy.
      <ul>
        <li> It was then remade in August of 2018, , directed by Niki Caro and
      starring the Chinese-American actress Liu Yifei</li></p>
    </ul>
    <p>Mulan is also the eighth Disney princess (kinda)
      and the second character not based on a fairy tale.
      <ul>
        <li> Mulan isn't actually a princess. Mulan disguses herself as a male soldier, joins
        the army, taking her father's place in the Chinese army
        when he's called upon to fight the Huns. She later on honoured by the Emperor
        and China itself.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>WHAT IT WAS BASED OFF OF...</p>
    <p>Mulan was actally based of a Chinese legend of warrior Hua Mulan
      <ul>
        <li>Hua Mulan was a female warrior who was famously described
        in the poem The Ballad of Mulan.
        The poem was apart of a collection of lyrics and songs that no longer exists. Just
        like in the movie Hua Mulan, like the Disney character,
        disguised herself as a man to spare her father. It's thought that Mulan isn't a true story,
        but is more inspired by different tales.</li>
